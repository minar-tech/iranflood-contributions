## Cultural Campaign of Museum's Aid to<br />Flood-Affected People and Heritage in Iran ##

*By: Mohamad Hekmat*

As you may know, from mid-March to April 2019 widespread flash flooding affected large parts of Iran, most severely in Golistan, Fars, Khuzestan, Loristan and other provinces. Unfortunately, many people have been hit, more than 60 people are reported to have died and several historical and archeological sites and monuments have damaged.

In this regard, my colleagues and I decided to run the campaign in order to help the flood-affected people through museums in the principle of museology. The purpose of the campaign is promoting knowledge of heritage environments where have been affected by the flood and people who live in those areas as heritage protectors through museums activities.   

The project aims to make connections between museums and the society's demands, which the first priority is the flood relief in present. In this sense, we focus on the origins of museums collections where have been struggling with the flood such as the Loristan province related to historical Bronzes collections, Golestan province related to Turkaman Carpets and Glass collections, Susa (Khuzestan) associated to Elamites and Achaemenian collections, Shiraz (Fars) for Islamic era collections and etc.

### How to participate in the campaign ###

- Promotion: Illustrating your museum objects which belong to flood-hit areas in Iran along with a description of their origins related to the flood disaster on the museum’s Instagram page, facebook and other social networks of your museum.

- Programme: Organizing temporary exhibitions and events related to those museum objects and the flood disaster.
You may also collect donations in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross for the flood-hit people in Iran at your museum.

### The Campaign Messages ###
